ProActiveCare is an AI-driven chronic disease management platform designed to provide proactive and preventive care for patients with diabetes and cardio-metabolic conditions. Developed by Team A cube for the IMPACT-AI-THON 2026, the project aims to shift healthcare from reactive treatment based on infrequent clinic visits to continuous, predictive monitoring.
Core Problem and Goals
The project addresses several gaps in current chronic care:
Reactive Care: Current management is often episodic and reactive rather than continuous.
Siloed Data: Health data from wearables, CGMs, and EHRs often remain disconnected.
Manual Interpretation: Clinicians currently spend excessive time on manual data interpretation without predictive tools.
Vision: The goal is to redefine chronic disease management by providing a unified longitudinal patient view and predictive decision-support tools.
The Solution & Key Functionality
The platform functions as a comprehensive management tool with several key features:
Continuous Monitoring: It integrates real-time health data, lifestyle patterns, and clinical insights.
AI-Driven Risk Stratification: Machine learning models analyze vitals and medical history to provide real-time risk predictions and early alerts for issues like glycemic instability.
Personalized Interventions: An intelligent engine delivers tailored treatment recommendations and preventive care plans for each patient.
Unified Platform: Delivers these insights through a
Technical Stack
The platform is built using the following technologies.
Frontend: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a responsive user interface.
Backend: Python is utilized for AI processing and secure data handling.
AI Core: Focused on risk prediction models and intelligent recommendation engines.
Cloud & Data: Scalable cloud storage for managing large health datasets.
Impact and Feasibility
The project follows "Human-in-the-Loop" decision-making principles to ensure AI insights are effectively utilized by clinicians. Evidence cited in the proposal suggests that AI-enabled systems can significantly improve patient outcomes, such as helping 71% of participants achieve an A1C of 6.5% or lower.
